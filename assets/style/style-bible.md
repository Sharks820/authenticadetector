# Style Bible: AuthenticaDetector Universe

## Visual Goals
- Professional, clean anime-cartoon look with a credible product feel.
- One unified art style across characters, monsters, UI, icons, and sprites.
- 2.5D depth via shadows and glow, not heavy 3D.

## Palette
- Base: #0a0d14 (bg), #12161f (surface), #1a1f2e (surface 2)
- Text: #f8fafc (primary), #b4bcd0 (secondary), #7c859f (muted)
- Accents: #7c4dff (purple), #22d3a6 (green), #f472b6 (pink)
- Utility: #f59e0b (warning), #ef4444 (danger), #22c55e (success)
- Highlights: #f6c7a2 (skin), #f1d07a (metal)

## Line Weight and Shading
- Line weight: 6px at 512x512 character/sprite artboards (scale down as needed); 2px at 24x24 icons.
- Shading: 2-3 tone cel shading with subtle gradient highlights.
- No painterly textures or photo sources.

## Typography
- Headings: Space Grotesk 600-700.
- Body: Space Grotesk 400-500 (fallback to Inter if needed).
- Lettering is clean and modern; no heavy serif fonts.

## Spacing and Radius
- Spacing system: 4/8/12/16/24/32px.
- Radius system: 6/10/14/20px.
- Buttons and cards use consistent glow and shadow.

## Icon Rules
- 24x24 grid, stroke-based, 2px stroke.
- Rounded caps and joins, no mixed icon families.
- Use currentColor for stroke so UI can theme icons.

## FX Language
- Fairy dust: soft sparkles and small glows.
- Corruption: neon shards, glitch wisps, angular runes.
- Impacts: short burst particles with teal/pink accents.

## Do / Do Not
- Do keep silhouettes readable at small sizes.
- Do keep the same outline weight across assets.
- Do use neon accents sparingly for high contrast.
- Do not mix photoreal or painterly textures.
- Do not use different icon families in the same UI.
- Do not use full black on dark backgrounds for text.
