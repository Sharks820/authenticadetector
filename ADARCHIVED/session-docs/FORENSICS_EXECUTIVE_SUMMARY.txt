FORENSICS SCAN MODE - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

PROJECT: AuthenticaDetector - Forensics Feature Validation & Testing
AGENT: Detection-Forensics (Forensics Scan Testing)
DATE: December 20, 2025
STATUS: INVESTIGATION COMPLETE

================================================================================
THE ISSUE IN 3 SENTENCES
================================================================================

The Forensics Scan Mode UI exists but is completely non-functional. Enabling
the toggle and running a scan produces identical results to a regular Deep
Scan - no enhanced analysis, no stricter thresholds, no performance
improvements. This is misleading to professional users who expect "maximum
accuracy" from the labeled feature.

================================================================================
CRITICAL FINDINGS
================================================================================

✓ UI Toggle: Works (turns forensics mode on/off)
✓ Progress Messages: Display correctly
✗ Actual Analysis: Forensics does NOTHING different
✗ Result Mode: Returns 'deep' instead of 'forensics'
✗ Badge System: Cannot award "Forensics Fan" badge (broken)

8 BUGS IDENTIFIED:
1. No forensics execution path (can't run forensics logic)
2. Mode flag not passed to analysis function (can't differentiate)
3. Result mode never = 'forensics' (results mislabeled)
4. No forensics-specific thresholds (same accuracy as Deep)
5. Analysis resolution same as Deep (256x256, no improvement)
6. FFT skipped on large images (frequency analysis lost)
7. Module timeouts fixed at 4000ms (no extra time)
8. Forensics badge unawardable (game progression broken)

================================================================================
WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN VS. WHAT DOES
================================================================================

CURRENT BEHAVIOR:
  User clicks Advanced toggle
  → Enables "Forensics Mode"
  → Clicks "Deep Scan"
  → Deep Scan runs identically
  → One extra explanation message added
  → Result shows "Deep Scan"
  → Badge never awarded

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
  User clicks Advanced toggle
  → Enables "Forensics Mode"
  → Clicks "Deep Scan"
  → Forensics mode runs with:
     • Higher resolution (512x512 vs 256x256)
     • Extended timeouts (6000ms vs 4000ms)
     • Stricter AI threshold (≥78 vs ≥75)
     • Stricter real threshold (≤22 vs ≤25)
     • Higher confidence bar (≥90 vs ≥88)
     • Takes 6-10 seconds (vs 3-6 seconds)
  → Result shows "Forensics Scan"
  → Badge awarded when result.mode = 'forensics'

================================================================================
IMPACT ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

SEVERITY: P1-CRITICAL (Feature completely non-functional)

USER IMPACT:
  - Professional users expect forensics features that don't exist
  - High-stakes verification relies on non-existent enhanced analysis
  - Misleading UI erodes user trust
  - Competitors with functional forensics gain advantage

BUSINESS IMPACT:
  - Incomplete feature visible in UI
  - Professional users may migrate to competitors
  - Badge system permanently broken
  - Credibility damage

TECHNICAL IMPACT:
  - Core analysis code untested for forensics mode
  - No forensics-specific logic in detection pipeline
  - Badge award system broken for forensics type

================================================================================
THE FIX
================================================================================

EFFORT: 2-3 hours (implementation + testing)
RISK: Medium (core logic changes, but well-isolated)
COMPLEXITY: Medium (requires understanding analysis flow)

10 CODE CHANGES REQUIRED:
  1. Update startScan() to detect forensics mode
  2. Modify analyzeImage() signature for forensics parameter
  3. Use higher resolution (512x512) for forensics
  4. Extend FFT timeout (6000ms) for forensics
  5. Extend module timeouts (6000ms) for forensics
  6. Apply forensics-specific thresholds
  7. Boost confidence for high indicator agreement
  8. Return correct mode='forensics' in results
  9. Update progress messages for forensics
  10. Add helper function for large image downsampling

  - Code locations with line numbers
  - Before/after code provided
  - Testing checklist included
  - Rollback plan available

RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

IMPLEMENT OPTION A: FULL FORENSICS MODE FIX

Reasoning:
  ✓ Feature already in UI (visible to users)
  ✓ Implementation is fully documented and ready
  ✓ Professional users expect this capability
  ✓ Badge system depends on proper implementation
  ✓ Reasonable effort (2-3 hours)
  ✓ Manageable risk with proper testing
  ✓ Clear competitive advantage
  ✓ Restores user trust

Alternative Options:
  Option B: Remove forensics toggle (15 min, loses feature)
  Option C: Rename to "Deep+" (1 hour, still incomplete)

VERDICT: Option A is the best choice

================================================================================

KEY METRICS & PERFORMANCE
================================================================================

BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION:
  Quick Scan:  1-2 seconds (5 modules)
  Deep Scan:   3-6 seconds (12 modules)
  Forensics:   3-6 seconds (same as Deep, BROKEN)

AFTER IMPLEMENTATION:
  Quick Scan:  1-2 seconds (unchanged)
  Deep Scan:   3-6 seconds (unchanged)
  Forensics:   6-10 seconds (enhanced, stricter)

FORENSICS IMPROVEMENTS:
  Resolution:        256x256 → 512x512
  FFT Timeout:       3000ms → 6000ms
  Module Timeout:    4000ms → 6000ms
  AI Threshold:      ≥75 → ≥78 (stricter)
  Real Threshold:    ≤25 → ≤22 (stricter)
  High Confidence:   ≥88 → ≥90 (harder to achieve)
  Expected Duration: 6-10 seconds

TRADE-OFF: Longer processing time is acceptable for "maximum accuracy"
